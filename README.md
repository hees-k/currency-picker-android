  repositories {
    ...

  }
}
```

picker.setListener(new CurrencyPickerListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSelectCurrency(String name, String code, String symbol, int flagDrawableResID) {
        // Implement your code here
    }
});
picker.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "CURRENCY_PICKER");
```

That's it, all done.

```java
List<ExtendedCurrency> currencies = ExtendedCurrency.getAllCurrenciesList(); //List of all currencies
ExtendedCurrency[] currencies = ExtendedCurrency.CURRENCIES; //Array of all currencies
ExtendedCurrency currency = ExtendedCurrency.getCurrencyByName(currencyName); //Get currency by its name


String name = currency.getName();
String code = currency.getCode();
int flag = currency.getFlag();  // returns android resource id of flag or -1, if none is associated
String symbol = currency.getSymbol();

currency.loadFlagByCode();  // attempts to associate flag to currency based on its ISO code. Used if you create your own instance of Currency.class
